    <article class="post-content"><p>Apologies as I should have put more updates on my blog during VMworld week. I definitely was <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23vmworld%20arielsanchezmor">active on twitter</a>, but Hurricane Dorian was active as soon as I was heading home to Orlando and it took all of my attention. Hurricane Dorian was and still is a big deal - second strongest hurricane to make landfall in the Atlantic basin. Make sure you read up on how you can help the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/hurricane-dorian-aid-how-to-donate-to-rescue-relief-and-recovery-in-the-bahamas/2019/09/05/903ba688-cff4-11e9-a620-0a91656d7db6_story.html?noredirect=on">Bahamas</a> and the entire <a href="https://www.redcross.org/about-us/news-and-events/press-release/2019/red-cross-responds-to-hurricane-dorian-along-east-coast.html">East Coast</a> of the US with donations, as several people&rsquo;s lives have been severely impacted! And also make sure you understand if your employer can match your donations to amplify your efforts!</p>

<p>As I start to read through all the announcements and VMworld blog posts to build my own &ldquo;VMworld US 2019 field report&rdquo;, I thought I would link to some of the content I produced through &ldquo;live tweeting&rdquo; <em>as the announcements were made</em>. I realize not everyone likes the twitter thread format, so I&rsquo;ve taken advantage of the Thread Reader App <a href="https://twitter.com/threadreaderapp">twitter bot</a> to also leave links to the whole thread in webpage format.</p>

<p>VMworld US 2019 only had two days of general announcements. Typically there&rsquo;s a 3rd keynote day, Thursday, with forward looking technology, not broadcasted and is more of a conversational format of the art of the possible, not company product announcements. However, I attended the Future:Net event on Thursday and also live tweeted it. Future:Net is a network focused one day conference that happens parallel to VMworld. You can check the event&rsquo;s agenda and speakers here <a href="https://www.vmware.com/futurenet">https://www.vmware.com/futurenet</a></p>

<p>VMworld announcements - please note I had to stop tagging accounts as it would have resulted in a massive reply all, so I had to start a new thread to stop that. Both days of announcements are covered, as well as some of the sessions I went to:<br />
- <a href="https://twitter.com/arielsanchezmor/status/1166014446092746752?s=20">live tweet thread part 1</a><br />
- <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1166014446092746752.html">thread reader app webpage part 1</a><br />
- <a href="https://twitter.com/arielsanchezmor/status/1166023404400435200?s=20">live tweet thread part 2</a><br />
- <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1166023404400435200.html">thread reader app webpage part 2</a></p>

<p>Thursday Future:Net event:<br />
- <a href="https://twitter.com/arielsanchezmor/status/1167104970321039361?s=20">live tweet thread</a><br />
- <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1167104970321039361.html">thread reader app webpage</a></p>

<p>The Thread Reader App estimates it will take you 67 minutes to read through all the live tweets even in the simplified format, so I&rsquo;m sure you will have comments. Expect to see a complete report with public facing resources later tonight, and a vCommunity focused post in the weekend. Let me know what you think is missing via twitter!</p>

<p>best,</p>
