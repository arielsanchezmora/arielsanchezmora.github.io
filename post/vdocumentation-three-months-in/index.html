It was pretty neat that we got a 500 person room on Monday after the keynote, because people are very anxious to go into sessions at that point of the conference." />

    <article class="post-content"><p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>This is a retrospective blog post on the little <!-- raw HTML omitted --> open source project<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  that Edgar Sanchez <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@edmsanchez13<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and I launched in VMworld US 2017 named <!-- raw HTML omitted -->#vDocumentation<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>We submitted it as a  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> session in VMworld 2017<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and we were very happy to see that 1) it was approved 2) it was a popular session! It was pretty neat that we got a 500 person room on Monday after the keynote, because people are very anxious to go into sessions at that point of the conference. Even though it was our first time presenting in a global conference <em>ever</em>, people were very interested in the content and it practically filled out. We had great questions during and after it, we gave away lots of cheap stickers to the attendees so they would remember to google it later, we got lots of feedback after the talk, and that day we made new friends.</p>
<p>The good news didn&rsquo;t stop there - the session was <!-- raw HTML omitted --> voted a top session<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the <!-- raw HTML omitted --> youtube recording<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has been in the top 20 views report that <!-- raw HTML omitted --> William Lam generates<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and more importantly, we had people actually opening up issues and feature requests in GitHub. We created a #vDocumentation channel in the <!-- raw HTML omitted --> VMware Code Slack<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and have had contributions already from Justin Sider <!-- raw HTML omitted --> @jpsider<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  and very soon from Graham Barker <!-- raw HTML omitted --> @VirtualG_UK<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Edgar, who has written 95% of vDocumentation, released a v2.0, which changed the code from one big file to one file per cmdlet, to simplify future collaboration. He&rsquo;s also done several little improvements, and he still manages keeping the code in Github in sync with what&rsquo;s in the PowerShell Gallery. You can see in the PS Gallery page that 400+ people have <!-- raw HTML omitted --> downloaded it<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>So far, the project has gathered 42 stars in GitHub and much more unique visitors than I expected. You can see some cool open source visualizations webpages like this one from <!-- raw HTML omitted --> @artzub<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted --> this one from GitHub stats<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. There&rsquo;s also the cool Insights/Traffic page GitHub gives you, even though I can&rsquo;t figure how to change the date range :)</p>

<p>These stats are cool, but I also want to share why I think two newbies like Edgar and me have had &ldquo;success&rdquo; - if I may be so bold. Recently a blog post caught my attention - <!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ldquo;Growing a Community for a New Open Source Project&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an excellent contribution from Ben Pfaff <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Ben_Pfaff<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  and Justin Pettit <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Justin_D_Pettit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, two OVS contributors whom I admire. Even though vDocumentation is really small compared to real Open Source projects, I offered my viewpoints as to why we have had user engagement:</p>
<ul>
<li>We had a very targeted, public launch - #vDocumentation used a VMworld presentation as a starting point.</li>
<li>We gave out stickers at the end of the presentation so people would remember to look up the project easily if they were interested</li>
<li>We encouraged Twitter and VMware Code Slack feedback from day one, and made clear we wanted the project to improve past our original vision</li>
<li>We established a project &ldquo;personality&rdquo; of being welcoming to people new to open source collaboration, GitHub, PowerShell</li>
<li>We stated up front that we would support the project long term</li>
</ul>
<p>We think we have been successful with that approach. We know how difficult admin life can be already - we don&rsquo;t judge, we don&rsquo;t pretend we&rsquo;re GitHub or PowerCLI experts, we humbly ask for others to help us improve the project for everyone&rsquo;s benefit. We want to think that attitude has helped, and will help going forward.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading this far, and I hope to re-visit the project in another three months or so, and still be proud of it. Mostly, we wish people keep finding it useful, and we wish the list of contributors keeps growing :)</p>
